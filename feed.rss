Learn how to take advantage of the extra settings available to your package.</description><link>https://blog.swiftpackageindex.com/posts/the-swift-package-index-metadata-file-first-steps</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2020 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The vast majority of the information you see in <a href="https://swiftpackageindex.com">the package index</a> is generated from a single URL, the location of the package‚Äôs git repository.</p><p>From that URL we gather data from the repository itself, the package manifest, the GitHub API (yes, it‚Äôs GitHub only for now, but <a href="https://github.com/SwiftPackageIndex/SwiftPackageIndex-Server/issues/485">we do plan to support other hosts</a>), and from running builds of the package to check compatibility with operating systems and Swift versions.</p><h2>Edge cases</h2><p>Of course, as with everything in software development, it‚Äôs not long before you find yourself talking about edge cases.</p><p>While creating <a href="posts/launching-language-and-platform-package-compatibility">the build system</a>, we quickly encountered packages where watchOS targets failed to build. We use Xcode‚Äôs automatic scheme creation functionality while running builds, but Xcode generates schemes that always include test targets, and <code>XCTest</code> isn‚Äôt available on watchOS. Using automatic schemes for watchOS builds wasn‚Äôt going to work.</p><p>The only way to have these builds succeed is for our build system to use a specific scheme, rather than an automatically created one. Many packages already have schemes for this purpose, but as package authors can give schemes any name, it‚Äôs not possible to easily discover them.</p><h2>Enter the Swift Package Index configuration file</h2><p>Rather than trying to keep the build system 100% generic, we needed a mechanism for package authors to specify some configuration information, such as the scheme name to use to build watchOS targets.</p><p>We support this via a configuration file, <code>.spi.yml</code> which we will look for in the root of your Swift package repository.</p><h3>Schemes for watchOS</h3><p>You can see the popular package <a href="https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture"><code>swift-composable-architecture</code></a> by <a href="https://www.pointfree.co">Pointfree</a> making use of <a href="https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/blob/main/.spi.yml">this config file</a>:</p><pre><code class="language-yaml">version: 1
builder:
  configs:
  - platform: watchos
    scheme: ComposableArchitecture_watchOS
</code></pre><p>Our build servers look for this file and use any scheme information we find for each platform. If a platform isn‚Äôt listed, we use our default heuristics to determine the scheme as outlined in our <a href="https://swiftpackageindex.com/docs/builds#built-how">build FAQ</a>.</p><h3>Images for Linux</h3><p>Custom schemes aren‚Äôt all we support though. Package authors can also use the <code>.spi.yml</code> file to configure custom docker base images for our Linux builds.</p><p>We build packages for Linux with docker commands, selecting between the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/swiftlang/swift">various base images that Apple provide</a>.</p><pre><code class="language-bash">/usr/local/bin/docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/host -w /host swiftlang/swift:5.2.4 swift build --enable-test-discovery
</code></pre><p>This works well unless a package requires an OS-level dependency, like OpenSSL.</p><p>We may eventually provide our own set of base images for supported Swift versions that also include common dependencies like OpenSSL. For now, we are asking package authors whose builds fail due to missing dependencies to create their own for the Swift versions they support.</p><p>For security reasons, we don‚Äôt allow package authors to specify arbitrary images in the configuration file, so if you need to use this feature, please <a href="https://github.com/SwiftPackageIndex/SwiftPackageIndex-Server/issues/new">raise an issue asking for us to support a custom base image</a>.</p><p>The AWS library <a href="https://swiftpackageindex.com/soto-project/soto">Soto</a> is an example of a package that makes use of this feature in its <a href="https://github.com/soto-project/soto/blob/main/.spi.yml"><code>.spi.yml</code> file</a>:</p><pre><code class="language-yaml">version: 1
builder:
  configs:
  - platform: linux
    swift_version: '5.0'
    image: adamfowlerphoto/aws-sdk-swift:5.0
  - platform: linux
    swift_version: '5.1'
    image: adamfowlerphoto/aws-sdk-swift:5.1
  - platform: linux
    swift_version: '5.2'
    image: adamfowlerphoto/aws-sdk-swift:5.2
  - platform: linux
    swift_version: '5.3'
    image: adamfowlerphoto/aws-sdk-swift:5.3
</code></pre><h2>Future direction</h2><p>It‚Äôs early days for this configuration file. We created it to solve issues which package authors were facing trying to make sure that the language and platform compatibility we report reflects reality.</p><p>We expect this file to evolve, which is why it carries a version number. Here are some of the things we are planning to add over time, so that package authors can control them:</p><ul><li>Author metadata. Full name, blog URL, Twitter account, etc.</li><li>Package keywords or categories.</li><li>The location of any hosted documentation for a package.</li><li>Sponsorship or funding information for a package.</li></ul><p>More metadata possibilities are under discussion in <a href="https://github.com/SwiftPackageIndex/SwiftPackageIndex-Server/issues/435">this GitHub issue</a>. This is a great place to chime in if you have suggestions.</p><h2>File format</h2><p>We chose <code>YAML</code> as the file format because it is an uncontroversial, universally beloved format that is entirely <a href="https://www.arp242.net/yaml-config.html">free of issues</a>. üò¨</p><p>Seriously though, we chose YAML as it‚Äôs relatively easy for a human to read and write, and it‚Äôs well supported in Swift. While it has some downsides compared to JSON, we believe it‚Äôs a more practical format given that package authors need to create this file manually.</p><p>Of course, we‚Äôll let adoption be the guide as to how well it is working in practice!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.swiftpackageindex.com/posts/funding-the-future-of-the-swift-package-index</guid><title>Funding the Future of the Swift Package Index</title><description>Many open-source projects are just code and don‚Äôt need constant attention.

Here‚Äôs what we found.</description><link>https://blog.swiftpackageindex.com/posts/building-3238-packages-for-apple-silicon</link><pubDate>Wed, 9 Sep 2020 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As part of the <a href="https://blog.swiftpackageindex.com/posts/launching-language-and-platform-package-compatibility/">Swift Package Index build system</a>, we have processed what must be the most extensive test of Apple Silicon compatibility outside of Apple.</p><p>At the time of writing, we currently have 12,942 Apple Silicon builds in our database covering 3,238 packages. Why so many? We test up to <a href="https://swiftpackageindex.com/SwifQL/SwifQL/builds">three versions of each package</a> and compile each version with both <code>xcodebuild</code> and <code>swift build</code>.</p><p>I‚Äôm sure that many of the Apple Silicon DTK machines Apple shipped around the world are working very hard, testing apps for compatibility, but I‚Äôm not sure any of them have worked quite as hard as ours has. üöÄ</p><h2>What did we find?</h2><p>As you might expect, there‚Äôs plenty of good news. For packages with successful Intel builds, the <em>vast majority</em> also successfully build for Apple Silicon. üëç</p><p>There are failures, though, and the most interesting failures are where the build fails on Apple Silicon while the corresponding Intel build succeeds. In cases like this, that indicates a compatibility issue that will potentially need some attention from the package author. We‚Äôve identified 139 packages (~4%) where this is the case, and have <a href="https://gist.github.com/daveverwer/ae08ad14a7a975e0488503282b4f1dbf">compiled a list of them for reference</a>.</p><p>There are a few common errors that we‚Äôre observing in these failures, and most of them are from one of the following problems:</p><ul><li>Any inline assembly will fail, obviously!</li><li><code>Float80</code> is unavailable.</li><li><code>x86_thread_state64_t</code> is unavailable.</li><li><code>__darwin_arm_thread_state64' has no member '__rsp'</code>.</li><li><code>cannot convert value of type 'CVaListPointer' to expected argument type '__darwin_va_list?'</code>.</li><li>Sometimes, the compiler crashes!</li></ul><p>Even though 139 failing packages might sound like a lot, it‚Äôs not that bad, especially when you consider that many of the failures all fail due to an issue in a common base dependency, <a href="https://swiftpackageindex.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect"><code>PerfectLib</code></a>.</p><h2>Where do we go from here?</h2><p>Even though the results are generally positive, it does show that there‚Äôs a bit of work that the community need to do to ensure the transition to Apple Silicon is as smooth as possible.</p><p>If you‚Äôre a package author and do not have a DTK machine at your disposal, please feel free to use ours via the Swift Package Index build system! Make changes to your packages, push them to a pre-release tag (for example, X.X.X-arm-beta-X) and the build system will pick up that tag and build it. You should see new build results, usually within a couple of hours of pushing a tag.</p><p>If you have any problems with the build system, there‚Äôs a couple of ways to contact us. We‚Äôre in the <code>#swiftpackageindex</code> channel over at the <a href="https://swift-package-manager.herokuapp.com">SwiftPM Slack</a>, or if it looks like there might be something wrong, please <a href="https://github.com/SwiftPackageIndex/SwiftPackageIndex-Server/issues/new">raise an issue on GitHub</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.swiftpackageindex.com/posts/launching-language-and-platform-package-compatibility</guid><title>Launching Language and Platform Package Compatibility</title><description></description><link>https://blog.swiftpackageindex.com/posts/launching-language-and-platform-package-compatibility</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Aug 2020 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What‚Äôs the first question you need an answer to after finding a package that fits your needs?</p><blockquote><p>‚ÄúDoes this package work with the Swift version and platform that my app uses?‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>When we initially launched the Swift Package Index, we attempted to answer this question with the metadata available in the package manifest. Namely the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/package/3197887-swiftlanguageversions"><code>swiftLanguageVersions</code></a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/package/3197886-platforms"><code>platforms</code></a> properties.</p><p>The problem is that neither of those properties is perfect. <code>swiftLanguageVersions</code> isn‚Äôt granular enough, only <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/swiftversion">officially</a> allowing values of <code>v4</code>, <code>v4_2</code>, and <code>v5</code>. The <code>platforms</code> property is better, but doesn‚Äôt let package authors declare compatibility with non-Apple operating systems such as Linux.</p><p>Wouldn‚Äôt it be fantastic if you could see a matrix like this for <em>every</em> package? üòç</p><picture>
  <source srcset="/images/promisekit-language-and-platform-metadata~dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)">
  <img src="https://blog.swiftpackageindex.com/images/promisekit-language-and-platform-metadata~light.png" alt="The language and platform compatibility matrix for PromiseKit.">
</picture><p>Look at how information-rich that matrix is. You can instantly see that the latest stable version of <a href="https://swiftpackageindex.com/mxcl/PromiseKit">PromiseKit</a> is compatible with every version of Swift back to 4.2, and every platform, including Linux. Then, you can see that the alpha version in development drops support for iOS, tvOS, and watchOS, and Swift 4.2. That seems suspicious, right? Keep looking, and you‚Äôll see that the default branch fixes all those issues and restores compatibility. I‚Äôm confident looking at that matrix that when 7.0.0 is released, it‚Äôll have green ticks across the board, but I also know to not depend on this current alpha. That‚Äôs practical, actionable information.</p><p>When we started thinking about how best to solve this problem, the obvious best solution was to build the packages! What better way to see if a package is compatible with Swift 4.2 than to build it with the version of <code>xcodebuild</code> that shipped with Xcode 10.1.</p><p>So that‚Äôs what we did, and it‚Äôs available right now. Why not <a href="https://swiftpackageindex.com">give it a try</a> by searching for a few of your favourite packages? üöÄ</p><h3>Accurate, real-world compatibility data</h3><p>It‚Äôs a little more complicated than ‚Äújust build each package‚Äù though. A package might build with Swift 5.2 on iOS, but that same build might fail using Swift 5.2 on macOS due to a UIKit dependency, or other macOS specific issue. What‚Äôs needed is a <em>matrix</em> of builds to generate an accurate picture of compatibility.</p><p>So, if we run builds using Swift 5.1 on iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and with Linux and <em>any</em> of them pass, it‚Äôs compatible with Swift 5.2. If <em>any</em> version of Swift builds without failure on iOS, then the package supports iOS.</p><p>We ended up with a platform list of:</p><ul><li>iOS using <code>xcodebuild</code></li><li>macOS using <code>xcodebuild</code></li><li>macOS using <code>swift build</code> (there are good reasons where <code>swift build</code> would pass in circumstances where <code>xcodebuild</code> might fail)</li><li>macOS using <code>xcodebuild</code> on Apple Silicon (yes, compiled using a DTK!)</li><li>macOS using <code>swift build</code> on Apple Silicon</li><li>tvOS using <code>xcodebuild</code></li><li>watchOS using <code>xcodebuild</code></li><li>Linux using <code>swift build</code></li></ul><p>We then decided on a list of Swift compiler versions we‚Äôd like to check compatibility with:</p><ul><li>Swift 4.2 (4.2.1)</li><li>Swift 5.0 (5.0.1)</li><li>Swift 5.1 (5.1.3)</li><li>Swift 5.2 (5.2.4)</li><li>Swift 5.3 (beta)</li></ul><p>That‚Äôs up to 32 builds per package, but that‚Äôs just the beginning. What if there‚Äôs a stable release and a beta release? The stable version might support Swift 4.2 and higher, and the new beta might drop support for anything less than Swift 5.2. That‚Äôs information which would be important when choosing a package, so we need to show it. As we also track the status of the default branch, we must build that too, and we‚Äôve quickly arrived at a place where we might need to run 96 builds <em>per package</em>! With almost 3,200 packages in the index, that‚Äôs potentially more than 300,000 builds! üòÖ</p><p>In practice, it‚Äôs less than that as most packages don‚Äôt have a current beta release, but it‚Äôs still a <em>lot</em> of builds. We‚Äôve processed more than 200,000 builds as I write this, and we‚Äôre not quite finished. As of today, we‚Äôre at 99% though, so we almost made it before launch! üò¨</p><p>If you‚Äôve been following <a href="https://twitter.com/daveverwer/status/1291808885259620353">these tweets</a>, it should be obvious what all that processing was! Let‚Äôs take a look at the last <strong>30 days</strong> of CPU graphs for our production server, a 2018 Mac mini with 32Gb RAM and a 6-core i7 CPU:</p><img src="https://blog.swiftpackageindex.com/images/production-server-thirty-day-cpu-graph.png" alt="A graph showing a few spikes of CPU activity, followed by a sustained 100% CPU load."/><p>You can see a few of our final test runs in that graph, and then we started processing for real. Since then, we‚Äôve kept the CPU completely pegged for more than two weeks. We‚Äôve also had our staging Mac mini, a spare 2016 MacBook Pro, and a DTK working on builds too.</p><h3>Everyone loves badges</h3><p>Providing compatibility information on this site is one thing, but everyone loves adorning their packages pages with <a href="https://shields.io">shields.io</a> badges, don‚Äôt they? If you maintain an open-source project, wouldn‚Äôt you like to show off real compatibility status in your README file, like this?</p><img src="https://blog.swiftpackageindex.com/images/rester-readme-with-spi-badges.png" alt="A screenshot of a GitHub page with badges that show the Swift and platform compatibility for the package."/><p>If you‚Äôre a package author, click the ‚ÄúCopy badge‚Äù button below each of the compatibility matrices and you‚Äôll have a Markdown image link in your clipboard, ready to use.</p><p>Your users will always see live, accurate compatibility information that updates whenever you release a new version.</p><h3>Credit where it‚Äôs due!</h3><p>First of all, we‚Äôd like to thank our kind friends at <a href="https://macstadium.com">MacStadium</a> for providing the significant hosting resources for this project as part of their <a href="https://www.macstadium.com/opensource">open-source programme</a>. At one point we were a little concerned that we might melt their machines, and we very glad that we didn‚Äôt. They‚Äôve performed incredibly.</p><p>We also want to say thank you to <a href="https://twitter.com/aciidb0mb3r">Ankit Aggarwal</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/neonacho">Boris B√ºgling</a> of Apple. Their tireless help and support on the <a href="https://swift-package-manager.herokuapp.com">SwiftPM Slack</a> saved us countless hours figuring out the correct way to approach this problem.</p><p>Finally, we‚Äôd love to say thank you to everyone who provided help and feedback along the way as we built this feature. We couldn‚Äôt have done it without any of you.</p><h3>Wrapping up</h3><p>Some package authors set up continuous integration for their packages and of course, that includes a build step. That usually only covers one version of Swift though, and the information gets hidden away in a different place in each repo. We think that by centralising this data and making it available for <em>all</em> packages, we should be able to help this community make better decisions about their dependencies, and that‚Äôs what this site is all about.</p><p>We hope you love this feature as much as we do! ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.swiftpackageindex.com/posts/say-hello-to-the-swift-package-index-blog</guid><title>Say Hello to the Swift Package Index Blog</title><description>It‚Äôs always hard to know when to ship v1 of a project.
