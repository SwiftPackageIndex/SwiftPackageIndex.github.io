Thank you all for checking it out and spreading the word.</p><p>It‚Äôs still early days for Swift Package Manager adoption but we are confident that it will become the dominant technology for Swift dependency management, and we want the Swift Package Index to grow right alongside it.</p><p>We believe we‚Äôre off to a great start with what we have so far, but this is only the beginning. We have so many ideas for ‚Äú<a href="https://github.com/SwiftPackageIndex/SwiftPackageIndex-Server/issues">bug fixes and improvements</a>‚Äù! üòÇ</p><p>Many open-source projects are just code and don‚Äôt need constant maintenance and monitoring, but the Swift Package Index is a little different. It‚Äôs a hosted instance of the site with a <a href="/posts/launching-language-and-platform-package-compatibility/">reasonably complex automated build system</a> that has run over 600,000 builds so far (increasing by 7,000 more every day!). It takes significant time and effort to keep things running smoothly.</p><p>We want to find a way to make sure that we can continue to give this site the time and attention it needs, but we don‚Äôt really want to go down the route of including advertising. Instead, we are opening up <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/SwiftPackageIndex">sponsorship on GitHub</a>.</p><p>If you (or your company) would like to support the site, we would be thrilled to be able to make this a community-funded effort for years to come.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/SwiftPackageIndex"><img src="/images/sponsorship-goal-100-sponsors.png" alt="A screenshot of our GitHub sponsors goal showing 1% of 100 sponsors."/></a></p><p>Also, a huge thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/cocoanetics">Oliver</a>, who beat us to even announcing this by sponsoring the project yesterday! Thanks for being our very first sponsor. üòç</p><p>Thank you!<br>Dave &amp; Sven</p><hr/><div class="what">The <a href="https://swiftpackageindex.com">Swift Package Index</a> is a search engine for Swift packages with one goal. <strong>To help you make better decisions about dependencies.</strong> For more information, the best place to start is with the <a href="https://swiftpackageindex.com/faq">Frequently Asked Questions</a>.</div></div></main><footer><div class="inner"><nav><ul><li><a href="https://swiftpackageindex.com/privacy">Privacy and Cookies</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/swiftpackages">Twitter</a></li></ul><p><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/SwiftPackageIndex">Please consider supporting this project</a></p><small>Kindly hosted by<a href="https://macstadium.com/">MacStadium</a></small></nav></div></footer></body></html>
