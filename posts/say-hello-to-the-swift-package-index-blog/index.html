Which features get included? Are there things that can wait? Itâ€™s a balancing act. Youâ€™re excited to show the world what you built, but is it good enough?</p><p>One decision we made when shipping the <a href="https://swiftpackageindex.com">Swift Package Index</a> was that a blog could wait. Looking back now, it feels like that was the right decision. The launch went smoothly, you all reacted very kindly and positively to it, and we went back to work fixing bugs and working on new features.</p><p>However, we always knew weâ€™d need somewhere to write about what we are doing with this project. Weâ€™d love to tell you about some of the interesting technical challenges we faced, but most of all we want to tell you about the new features weâ€™ve been building...</p><p>What features? Youâ€™ll have to wait just one more week to find out what weâ€™ve been working on, but weâ€™re pretty excited about it, and thatâ€™s why now was the right time to launch this blog.</p><p class="dim">Now we just need to keep writing on it! ðŸ˜¬</p><hr/><div class="what">The <a href="https://swiftpackageindex.com">Swift Package Index</a> is a search engine for Swift packages with one goal. <strong>To help you make better decisions about dependencies.</strong> For more information, the best place to start is with the <a href="https://swiftpackageindex.com/faq">Frequently Asked Questions</a>.</div></div></main><footer><div class="inner"><nav><ul><li><a href="https://swiftpackageindex.com/privacy">Privacy and Cookies</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/swiftpackages">Twitter</a></li></ul><p><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/SwiftPackageIndex">Please consider supporting this project</a></p><small>Kindly hosted by<a href="https://macstadium.com/">MacStadium</a></small></nav></div></footer></body></html>
